Rodroid
=======
[RoDI] (http://rodibot.com/) (Robot Didáctico Inalámbrico) Android client.

The end goal of this project is to not only allow controlling a RoDI from an
Android phone, but to provide a teaching and learning platform for kids who
may not have daily access to a computer for using their RoDi.

So the plan is to add some basic (and possibly visual) programming language
that can be used to send directions to a RoDi from the phone, allowing kids
to learn about computational thinking concepts without needing a computer.
